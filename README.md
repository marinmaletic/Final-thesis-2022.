# Final-thesis-2022.
## Motivation
Semantic image segmentation for application in environment exploration - Bachelor's degree final thesis at Faculty of electrical engineering and computing, University of Zagreb.

## Description
The goal was to Implement DeepLabV3+ architecture for Multi-class Semantic Segmentation. 
The model was written and trained in Google Colaboratory environment, given the vast processing power needed.


### References:

The following code is a combination of existing DeepLabV3+ architectures modified to be trained on [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/) and tested on roads in Zagreb, Croatia
